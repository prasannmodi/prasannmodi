Task Description

Attached is a CSV file containing anonymized data on how many tests are conducted per client daily along with other parameters that may affect this value. 

company_id - id representing our client
company_type - string value of what type of company it is
date - the date when tests were conducted
avg_pesq_score - average PESQ (audio quality metric ) score across all tests for that day
quality_too_poor - the number of tests that were marked quality too poor
number_busy - the number of tests that returned busy during the test
temporarily_unable_to_test - the number of tests that we could not carry out due to an issue on our side
outage_sec - the number of seconds the client's lines were down for that day
number_test_types - the number of different test types that the client conducts with us
numbers_tested - how many unique numbers they have in testing
followup_tests - the amount of follow-up connection tests were conducted - this happens when a number returns busy
min_commit - this is the number of minimum monthly tests a client can conduct before getting charged more
has_min_commit - flag to state if the client has a minimum commitment
volume_tests - the amount of total tests conducted that day for the client
is_testing - flag stating  whether the client is still testing with us

What we would like you to do is carry out some data analysis and build a model using python to predict how many tests will be conducted for a client on a future date.
